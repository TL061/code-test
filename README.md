Question 1.

A group of kids (N in total) are about to play a game. The first one starts with saying number 1, and each player thenceforth counts one number in turn. However, if the number is a multiple of 3, the kid should say Fizz instead. Similarly, say Buzz for a number that is multiple of 5 and Woof for any multiples of 7. Given there are N kids, please return the correct responses from them in order.

For example,
if N is 5, your method returns 1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz"
if N is 15, your method returns 1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz", "Woof", 8, "Fizz", "Buzz", 11, "Fizz", 13, "Woof", "Fizz Buzz"



Question 2.

String reversion:
Given a valid string, please return the reversed version of it. For example, if "xyz123" is the input, your method returns "321zyx".



Question 3.

Given a number of coins with different denominations, e.g. [1, 2, 5] and test if they could be used to make up a certain amount (N), assuming you can use unlimited number of coins in each denomination.

For example,
if coins = [1, 2, 5] and N = 11, return true
if coins = [3, 77] and N = 100, return false
